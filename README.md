- **Flask-based Web Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for customers and an API for recommendations and bundles.

## Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- mlxtend (for Apriori)
- Joblib (for saving models)

## Project Structure
- **preprocess.py**: Loads and preprocesses the data, trains models for collaborative filtering and association rule mining, and saves them.
- **app.py**: Loads the models and provides functions to generate product recommendations and bundles.
- **recommender.py**: Contains the recommendation logic for KNN-based product suggestions and association rule-based bundle suggestions.
- **Flask Web App**: Provides an interface for users to get personalized recommendations and bundles.
